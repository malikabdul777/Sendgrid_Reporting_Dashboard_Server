# MongoDB Connection Fix

## Problem

The server was experiencing MongoDB connection issues, resulting in errors like:

```
Connection Failed!
Error checking token: MongooseError: Operation `gmailauths.findOne()` buffering timed out after 10000ms
```

This error occurs when the MongoDB driver cannot establish a connection to the database within the default timeout period (10 seconds).

## Solution

The MongoDB connection in `server.js` has been updated with the following improvements:

1. **Added Connection Options**:
   - `useNewUrlParser: true` - Use the new URL parser
   - `useUnifiedTopology: true` - Use the new Server Discovery and Monitoring engine
   - `serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 30000` - Increased server selection timeout to 30 seconds
   - `socketTimeoutMS: 45000` - Increased socket timeout to 45 seconds
   - `family: 4` - Force using IPv4 to avoid potential IPv6 issues

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed error logging in the connection promise catch block
   - Added event listeners for connection events:
     - `error` - Log connection errors
     - `disconnected` - Log when the connection is lost
     - `reconnected` - Log when the connection is re-established

## How to Test

1. Restart the server
2. Check the console logs for successful connection messages
3. Test the API endpoints that interact with the database

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Connection Pooling**: The MongoDB driver already implements connection pooling by default. The default pool size is 5 connections.

2. **Retry Strategy**: Consider implementing a more robust retry strategy if connection issues persist.

3. **Health Checks**: Implement a health check endpoint that verifies the database connection status.

4. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Consider using different connection options for development and production environments.

5. **Database Credentials**: Ensure that the MongoDB Atlas username and password are correct and that the IP address of your server is whitelisted in the MongoDB Atlas network access settings.
